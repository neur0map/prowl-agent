// -L` by hand. It resolves the symbol's CURRENT line range from the index and
// asks git for the commits over that range, newest first. Like def, span, and
// peek it needs the workspace root (to run git there), so it is not built from
// the generic helper. A --limit caps how many commits a symbol returns so a
// long-lived one does not flood the context.
