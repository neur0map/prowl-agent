// fuseRRF merges the co-equal ranking signals -- vector KNN and the tier-ordered

// list contributes 1/(k0+rank) to a chunk's score, so a chunk both signals agree
// on accumulates their contributions and rises; k0=60 is the standard RRF
// damping. A stable sort by score keeps a chunk's first-seen position on a tie,
// so lists passed earlier win ties over later ones (vector before lexical).
//
// The doc signal is deliberately NOT a fusion input here. It was measured on the
// hermes corpus that fusing it as a third RRF list -- at any weight -- cannot
// satisfy the acceptance bar: at full weight it floods the top and floats test
// files above source (the exact cross-encoder failure C5 forbids), and
// down-weighted enough to protect the ranking it drops the doc-only answer it
// exists to surface out of the window entirely. So the co-equal code signals are
// fused here, and the doc signal is applied afterwards by mergeDocRecall as
// recall only, which never touches the top-ten base results.

// docRecallFloor and docRecallCap govern where the doc recall pass may place a
// doc-only answer. A doc-only miss (a chunk whose doc comment answers the query
// while its code carries none of the query terms, found by neither the vector nor
// the lexical signal -- the redact.py case) is weaker evidence than a top-ten code
// match, so it is never allowed into the top ten: the window an agent actually
// reads, where every strong ranking answer -- and every regression-guard target --
// already sits. But appending it at the page tail fixes reachability without
// visibility; its rank there is set by however many chunks happen to share a
// common token like "log", not by how well the doc answers. So up to docRecallCap
// misses are inserted just below the read window, at docRecallFloor. Both are
// product constants -- the size of the window an agent scans, and a small recall
// budget -- not values tuned to make any query pass. The top ten stays identical
// to the base ranking, so no confident hit and no guard target can move; the cost
// is demoting a few mid-page code matches by a slot, much weaker evidence than a
// docstring that answers the query in the user's own words.

// results because its chunk is 22% docstring and 78% imports. Reordering the
// confident matches to make room for prose that merely describes a concept is
// precisely what made two cross-encoder rerankers worse on this corpus, so the doc
// signal may not move any of the top-ten base hits.
//
// Base order is preserved exactly. Doc-only misses (doc hits no base signal
// surfaced) are tier-sorted so a source file whose doc comment answers leads a
// test or doc file that merely mentions the concept -- the same source > tests >
// docs order searchChunksRanked imposes -- and up to docRecallCap of them are
// inserted at docRecallFloor, just below the read window. The window an agent
// reads, where every guard target sits, is therefore byte-identical to the base;
// only weaker mid-page code matches shift down by a slot.
